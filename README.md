# dgraph-js-ws

dGraph JS WebSocket Client

This is the JS WebSocket Client that accompanies [dgraph-ws-client](https://github.com/xanthous-tech/dgraph-ws-client).

# Usage

I am trying to keep the API contract as close to `dgraph-js` as possible, currently there is a notable difference in the client initialization code, where I abstracted out the client stub initialization.
